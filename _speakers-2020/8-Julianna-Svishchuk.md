  Alongside pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology, Julianna strives to prove that
  the arts and the sciences can and should exist alongside one another in science-driven educational and professional
  environments. She feels that expanding the artistic mind serves as a unique advantage for scientific thinking, and
  believes that students striving to succeed in the sciences should be exposed to the importance of both fields, and
  their interconnection. Julianna passionately seeks solace and inspiration through the means of dancing, painting,
  writing and photography, with no doubt that these avocations serve more as an asset, rather than a detriment, to the
  progress of her academic career.
