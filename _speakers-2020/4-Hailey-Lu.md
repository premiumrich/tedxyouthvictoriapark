  Hailey Lu is in her third year of Civil and Energy/Environmental engineering at the University of Calgary, Hailey has
  journeyed to 3 developing countries and at the age of 17, she founded her own social enterprise; JAMBO, to fund
  supplies for a rural Kenyan school. Hailey is actively involved in various clubs and organizations, and is a tireless
  advocate for issues regarding sustainability and education in developing countries. She believes that often,
  spontaneous actions don’t follow along with “tried and true” methods. However her willingness to take risks has led
  into meaningful action, such as through her starting an inclusive fitness club, or through taking action to make the
  U of C campus more sustainable, with 4SIGHT. Hailey is a student, environmentalist, entrepreneur, and community
  service scholar with the belief that whether we utilize tried and true methods or be willing to risk exploring
  uncharted territory, our ultimate goal is the same; accomplish tasks while staying driven, even under poor road
  conditions.
