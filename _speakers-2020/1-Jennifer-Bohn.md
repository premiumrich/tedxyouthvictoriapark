  Jen is a 4th year nursing student at the University of Calgary and an aspiring social entrepreneur. Jen personally
  defines a social entrepreneur to be someone who establishes an enterprise that aims to solve social problems or effect
  social change. Jen enjoys pursuing entrepreneurship because of the freedom and choices it offers. The social focus of
  social entrepreneurship allows her to feel more connected to work by being motivated by injustices larger than her.
  Jen loves to fill her free time with learning opportunities, friends, family, fitness, and food. In her talk, she is
  incredibly excited to share her interest for implicit bias and compassion with you and is equally eager to learn from
  you and this experience in return!
