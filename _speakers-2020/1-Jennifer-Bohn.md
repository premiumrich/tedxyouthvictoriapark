  Jen is a 4th year nursing student at the University of Calgary and is an aspiring social entrepreneur who enjoys
  pursuing entrepreneurship because of the freedom and choices it offers. She personally defines a social entrepreneur
  as someone who establishes an enterprise that aims to solve social problems or affect social change, and believes that
  the social focus of social entrepreneurship allows her to feel more connected to her work as it is motivated by social
  injustices much larger than herself. Jen loves to fill her free time with continuous learning opportunities, friends,
  family, fitness, and food. In her upcoming TEDx Talk, she is incredibly excited to share her interest for implicit
  bias and compassion with you, and is equally eager to learn from you and this experience in return!
