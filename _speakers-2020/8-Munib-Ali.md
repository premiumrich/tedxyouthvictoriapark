  "Swords can win territories but not hearts; forces can bend heads but not minds". As a philosophy that he champions to
  this day, Munib is unwavering in his desire to allow the power of the pen and dialogue to reach the corners of the

  international campaign where he serves as an official Ambassador - and The Common Denominator, which he founded in
  2019. Munib completed a B.Sc. (Hons) in Kinesiology, is a current Medical Student, and has developed a strong
  2020. portfolio of research with the Hotchkiss Brain Institute and the Human Performance Laboratory to further
