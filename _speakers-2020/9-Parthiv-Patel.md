  Parthiv Patel is a passionate technological and scientific thinker. As a 12th grade high school student at Western
  Canada High School, Parthiv is also a current student researcher at the University of Calgary. Having been highly
  fascinated by the growth and development of artificial intelligence from a young age, he hopes to see the intersection
  between Artificial Intelligence and other fields of science play a pivotal role towards shaping the future of
  humanity. Parthiv is also an avid advocate for youth-driven scientific research, having developed a novel cure for
  Urinary Tract Infections at the age of 15. When he's not staring at test tubes, he enjoys hiking and doing puzzles to
  challenge his thinking. As he puts it, "Your mind is only as strong as you make it."
