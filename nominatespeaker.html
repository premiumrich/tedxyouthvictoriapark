      TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark is looking for innovators, scientists, students, artists, environmentalists, writers, and
      any other creative individuals to share their experiences and ideas on our stage. Here, you are welcome to
      nominate yourself or someone else who you believe may be interested in speaking at our conference. 
      <br><br>
      Our event theme for TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark 2020 is "Ctrl Alt Del". The idea of Ctrl Alt Del is meant to highlight
      individuals who have dared to take <b>control</b> of their lives by <b>deleting</b> old, fixed-mindset based ideas
      and pushed their innovative, <b>alternate</b> ideas forward! More information regarding the meaning of this year's
      event theme can be found here:&nbsp;
