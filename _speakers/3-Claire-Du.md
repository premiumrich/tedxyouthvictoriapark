  Passionate about technology since she was young, Claire founded AI4Youth Canada at the age of 15. AI4Youth Canada is a
  federally incorporated non-profit organization, which focuses on connecting high school students across Canada with
  professors and influential industry leaders in Artificial Intelligence and promotes AI related experiential learning
  opportunities. She organized Canadaâ€™s first nationwide conference about AI specifically for high school students in
  2018, and AI4Youth Canada has directly impacted over 350 youth in Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia. Claire has
  been recognized by Startup Canada as a Prairies Region Nominee for the 2019 Young Entrepreneur Award, and has also
  received the Silver Achievement of Duke of Edinburgh International Award, and an Immigrants of Distinction Awards in
  2018. Claire firmly believes that empowering youth in the field of artificial intelligence is necessary to better
  prepare them to be the change-makers of the future.
