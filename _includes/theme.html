          Our event theme for this year is “Shifting Equilibrium: A Journey Into the Unknown.” “Shifting Equilibrium”
          is meant to represent individuals, communities, and ideas that have been (or will be) affected by some sort
          of vast technological, ideological, societal, or psychological change. In addition, the notion of
          “A Journey Into The Unknown” is meant to complement the idea of “Shifting the Equilibrium”, and is
          intended to represent people who dared to explore an environment that was completely unknown to them.
          More information regarding the underlying meaning of the event theme can be found here:
