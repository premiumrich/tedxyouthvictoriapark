					Our event theme for this year is “Shifting Equilibrium: A Journey Into the Unknown.” “Shifting Equilibrium” is meant to represent individuals, 
					communities, and ideas that have been (or will be) affected by some sort of vast technological, ideological, societal, or psychological change. 
					In addition, the notion of “A Journey Into The Unknown” is meant to complement the idea of “Shifting the Equilibrium”, 
					and is intended to represent people who dared to explore an environment that was completely unknown to them.
					<br><br>
					TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark believes in cultivating a community of engaged, empowered youth through the spreading of innovative ideas, 
					and we hope that you can join us at TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark 2019!
