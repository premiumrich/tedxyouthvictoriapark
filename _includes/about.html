          TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks
          (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged,
          and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages.
          TED believes passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world.

        <p class="text-muted">
          TEDx brings the spirit of TED’s mission of ideas worth spreading to local communities around the globe. TEDx
          events are organized by curious individuals who seek to discover ideas and spark conversations in their own
          community. TEDx events include live speakers and recorded TED Talks, and are organized independently under a
          free license granted by TED.

        <p class="text-muted">
          Founded in 2018, TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark is currently the only youth-based TEDx organization in the Calgary
          area, aimed towards serving youth between the ages of 13-22. The purpose of TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark is to
          explore the issues, ideas and questions that are central to young people today, and we firmly believe in
          providing an opportunity and platform for local youth to share their novel and innovative ideas to their local
          and global communities.
