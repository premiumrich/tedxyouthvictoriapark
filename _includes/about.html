					TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). 
					TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — 
					from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. 
					TED believes passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world.

				<p class="text-muted">
					TEDx brings the spirit of TED’s mission of ideas worth spreading to local communities around the globe. 
					TEDx events are organized by curious individuals who seek to discover ideas and spark conversations in their own community. 
					TEDx events include live speakers and recorded TED Talks, and are organized independently under a free license granted by TED.

				<p class="text-muted">
					Founded in 2018, TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark is currently the only youth-based TEDx organization in the Calgary area, 
					aimed towards serving youth between the ages of 13-22. The purpose of TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark is to explore the issues, 
					ideas and questions that are central to young people today, and we firmly believe in providing an opportunity and platform 
					for local youth to share their novel and innovative ideas to their local and global communities.
				</p>

					Our event theme for this year is “Shifting Equilibrium: A Journey Into the Unknown.” “Shifting Equilibrium” is meant to represent individuals, 
					communities, and ideas that have been (or will be) affected by some sort of vast technological, ideological, societal, or psychological change. 
					In addition, the notion of “A Journey Into The Unknown” is meant to complement the idea of “Shifting the Equilibrium”, 
					and is intended to represent people who dared to explore an environment that was completely unknown to them.
					<br><br>
					TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark believes in cultivating a community of engaged, empowered youth through the spreading of innovative ideas, 
					and we hope that you can join us at TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark 2019!
