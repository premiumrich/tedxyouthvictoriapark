				<p class="text-muted">
					TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). 
					TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — 
					from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. 
					TED believes passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world.

					Founded in 2018, TEDxYouth@VictoriaPark is currently the only youth-based TEDx organization in the Calgary area,
