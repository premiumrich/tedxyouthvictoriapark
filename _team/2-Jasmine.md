description: Jasmine is a keen grade 12 student constantly looking to take on a new challenge. When she isn't colour-coding her biology notes or binging The Office on Netflix, you can find her working on a variety of other extracurriculars, as she is a part of the Chief Superintendentâ€™s Student Advisory Council, the Sir Winston Churchill Slam Poetry Team, on Volunteer Churchill's Steering Committee, and is the Publicity Director for Operation Med School Calgary, and a whole lot more!
