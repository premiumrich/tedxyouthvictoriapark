  Catharine Bowman is a medical researcher, public speaker, and healthcare advocate with a profound interest in
  utilizing innovative thinking to approach societal healthcare challenges. In 2008, Catharine’s mother was diagnosed
  with stage-three metastatic cancer and shortly after treatment, developed lymphedema, an incurable and lifelong
  disease affecting the lymphatic system. At the age of 14, Catharine set out to create the first pharmacological
  treatment for lymphedema. Almost seven years later, Catharine is now a well-established lymphatic researcher,
  implementing novel research techniques and methods to further explore her original pharmacological therapeutic.
  Through her speaking campaign, “Let’s Talk Lymphedema”, Catharine has had the opportunity to share her research and
  advocacy journey at venues across North America and the UK. Reflecting on her life journey, Catharine’s resulting
  message is simple: “Know and utilize the foundation you stand upon when you journey into the unknown”.
