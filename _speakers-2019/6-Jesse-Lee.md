  Jesse Lee is currently an 11th grade high school student at Western Canada High School, a student researcher at both
  the University of Calgary and the University of Alberta, and a notebook enthusiast. He is working on numerous
  projects, including research into the science of ice nucleation, as well as one of the world’s very first reliable
  marijuana impairment detection devices. Jesse enjoys the simple things in life, and many of his ideas for projects are
  inspired by nature and the world around him. He regards nature as the world’s “oldest and best engineer”, and he has
  dedicated himself to learning all that he can from this unconventional mentor.
